// BenchmarkFramerAppend measures the per-packet cost of stream scheduling.
//
// Two quantities move independently, and the cases separate them so neither is
// read off a number that confounds both: how many streams are queued, which
// sets how many turns the scheduling loop takes, and how many urgency levels
// it walks. The floor case pins the second on its own — with nothing queued at
// all, any difference between revisions is the walk and nothing else. A
// connection that never sets a priority leaves seven of the eight levels empty
// for its whole life, so on the common path that walk finds nothing every time.
//
// Read the absolute nanoseconds between revisions, not the percentage. A fixed
// per-call cost sits underneath every case, so the same regression reports a
// different percentage depending on how much of that floor is in the
// denominator, and the single-stream cases are mostly floor.
//
// There is a resolution floor under that. At the 130-150ns/op the eight-stream
// cases sit at, this benchmark cannot resolve a sub-1% difference to a cause in
// the code, in either direction and whatever the p-value says: differences that
// small move under harness changes that do not touch the code being measured.
// Hoisting one clock read out of the loop moved a -0.4% reading at p=0.01 to
// -0.1% at p=0.88. Treat anything under about a percent as unresolved.
